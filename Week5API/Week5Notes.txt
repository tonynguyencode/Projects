// Ins_Event Delegation Note

What is the project purpose?

	- The new thing I can learn from this project is the button click and its design.
	
//They have a show letter button for every letter in the project. The primary learning should be learning how to build
a proper board like this one.
	
<!-- Alphabet letter buttons -->
They have a class id= "buttons" class="my-5"
The new css material are: 
	- display: inline-block
	- cursor: pointer


//Stu_Event 10

	// Creaing an input 
		var shoppingItem = $('input[name="shopping-input"]').val();   //This is where it will getting and storing the input value.

	// In addition, for a <ul>, we can add <li> within it
		var shoppingListItemE1 = $( '<li class="flex-row justify-space-between align-center p-2 bg-light text-dark">' );

	// We will set the text to of that <li> or list to the shopping item

		We can also append a BUTTON to a LIST 
		shoppingListItemE1.append('<button class= "btn btn-danger btn-small delete-item-btn">Remove</button>'   );
	
	//If we hit the remove button, then form will be cleared.

		$('input[name="shopping-input"]').value(''); //I set the value to blanks.

	// To refer the object that the function is being used
			
		var btnClicked = $(event.target);

		btnClicked.parent('li').remove(); //This code will trace back to the parent of this event target. AND remove it.

	// This new object method can assign function with its object

		shoppingListE1.on('click', '.delete-item-btn', handleRemoveItem);   //Event delegation on the 'shoppingListE1' to listen for click on any element with a 
													// class of 'delete-item-btn' 
		shoppingFormE1.on('submit', handleFormSubmit);											// This target a specific assets.
		
		//This is referring to the FORM with a button that can submit the form. It is an automacially function.
